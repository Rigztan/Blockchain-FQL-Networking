This repository contains the datasets for the research worl: Federated Q-Learning-based Secure, Fault Tolerant, and Energy Efficient Framework for Ad hoc Networks.
The framework integrates MicroChain-based trust management, Federated Q-learning for adaptive routing, and an Adaptive Cryptographic Engine (ACE) to provide a multilayer security solution for MANETs.
Datasets Provided:

1. NODE_MOBILITY.csv

Random Waypoint mobility data for 500 nodes.

2. TRAFFIC.csv

Packet-level CBR + Poisson arrival traffic logs.

3. TRUST_SCORES.csv

Trust scores computed using
0.5*R + 0.3*F + 0.2*C

4. ACE_LOG.csv

Selected crypto algorithms based on ACE rules.

5. ANOMALY_DETECTION.csv

RF + LSTM fused anomaly scoring.

6. FEDERATED_Q_LEARNING.csv

State vectors, actions, reward signals, and updated Q-values.

7. COMBINED_DATASET.csv

Merged dataset with dataset_name label.
